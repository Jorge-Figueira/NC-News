Welcome to my NC-NEWS frontend project. You can check what it currently looks like [ here](https://myncnews.netlify.app/).

## Description of the project

This is my individual project created as part of the Northcoders BootCamp at the end of the FrontEnd phase. It has been created to work on data from an API that I made during the backckend phase of the BootCamp. You can get the source code of the API [here] (https://github.com/Jorge-Figueira/NC-News-Backend) or access it [here] (https://pretend-you-reddit.herokuapp.com/api/).

This is a showcase of an app where users can comment, like and unlike news articles. The main article feed allows the user to filter the articles by topic and sort them in several ways, both in ascending or descending order.

## How to run the app.

The app has been written using the following libraries and versions:

React: 17.02
Axios: 0.26.0
Web-vitals:2.1.4

After you clone the repository, you should run `npm install` on your terminal to install all the required packages.
In order to start the app locally run `npm run start` on your terminal.

I hope you enjoy the app. I do appreciate any feedback you may have.
